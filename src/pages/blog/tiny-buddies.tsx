          <p>
            Today is the day I've finally found the strength to share our latest
            project with you â€” <strong>Tiny Buddies</strong>! Tiny Buddies is a
            mobile pixel pet game where you take care of your pet. You can play
            with it, dress it up to your liking, buy new toys, food, and
            clothes, and even decorate its home!
          </p>
          <p>
            The game is still in the very early stages of development, but we
            are closer to releasing version 1.0 than ever. It will be available
            for free on our Patronite. If you're interested in our game and
            would like to support us before its release, you can do so{' '}
